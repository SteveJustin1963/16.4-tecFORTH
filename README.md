# tec-FORTH

# Abstract
Forth, TEC-1, Z80, 

# Introduction 

Our genius, John Hardy has developed "Firth of Forth" (started 2019), for the TEC-1.
This project is to test, confirm and use this powerful system.

# Observe and Question 
* Is "Firth of Forth" a viable and robust Forth?
* Review the technical manual and expand until comprehensively complete.

 
# Theory - testable
* Test and report any bugs back through git. 



# Prediction
* "This is where the project gets interesting but nothing is ever smooth sailing, it's always hard" (Hardy 2020)
* Not enough RAM

# Method 

* Need Serial IO

Code for BitBang (Robertson 2019) not released yet, "tec-BANG" not ready (Justin 2020).
Bens Serial IO addon https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SERIAL-BG not avail, he is developing it into Video card, TBA (Gremmett 2019)

* Need UART

Make own addon, https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-APUS

* Install ROM Emulator, https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-ROM-EM-BG, for easy code loading. (https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-BOOT not ready)
* Load Forth, https://github.com/jhlagado/firth

"Firth is designed to run using a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial chip mapped to ports $80 and $81 (or 0x80 and 0x81) as per the hardware arrangement designed by Grant Searle." (Hardy 2020)
 

# Test
* JH internal tests
* Standard benchmark tests  
* Figforth, gforth, Peter Forth, etc
* Function test
* AM9511
* Forth Scientific Library

# Report, figures, tables
