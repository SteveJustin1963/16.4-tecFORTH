# tec-FORTH

Using John Hardy's "Firth of Forth", test on TEC-1


# Abstract
Forth, TEC-1, Z80, 

# Introduction 
John Hardy is developed a new Forth, “Firth of Forth” (2019- ) for the TEC-1 targeting the Z80 CPU. This project wants to test and confirm the viable and robust Forth.


# Observe and Question 
Test Firth 
viable 
robust 
rigorous testing  
manual comprehensive and complete

 
# Theory - testable
Testing and reporting any bugs back through git. 



# Prediction
Trust John! 

Not enough RAM

# Method 

Use ROM Emulator by Ben Grimmett https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-ROM-EM-BG

Load and boot Firth of Forth https://github.com/jhlagado/firth

"Firth is designed to run using a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial chip mapped to ports $80 and $81 (or 0x80 and 0x81) as per the hardware arrangement designed by Grant Searle." 
 


# Test
* UART test
* AM9511 test

* test against circa 1980s forth of the time, eg figforth
* Standard Forth test from domain
* Forth base function test, including JH test
* Forth higher functions
* Test Forth libraries 
* test Forth Scientific Library
* Test drivers for addons eg tec-APUS, APU
