# tec-FORTH

# Abstract
Forth, TEC-1, Z80, 

# Introduction 

Based on the brilliant work by John Hardy we now have "Firth of Forth" (started 2019)for the TEC-1 targeting the Z80 CPU.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth

This project is to  test, confirm and use this powerful system.

# Observe and Question 
Test Firth; viable and robust?
 
Review the technical manual and expand until comprehensively complete.

 
# Theory - testable
Testing and reporting any bugs back through git. 



# Prediction
Trust John! 

Not enough RAM
Need tec-APUS

# Method 

1. Install tec-APUS first for the UART
* Use ROM Emulator by Ben Grimmett https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-ROM-EM-BG
* Load and boot Firth of Forth https://github.com/jhlagado/firth

"Firth is designed to run using a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial chip mapped to ports $80 and $81 (or 0x80 and 0x81) as per the hardware arrangement designed by Grant Searle." 
 

# Test
* test against circa 1980s forth of the time, eg figforth
* Standard Forth test from domain
* Forth base function test, including JH test
* forth for AM9511
* test Forth Scientific Library

# Report, figures, tables

# Results

# Discuss objectively, scientific significance
