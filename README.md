“Your mission Jim, should you decide to accept it is to; 
* Investigate John Hardy’s brilliant https://github.com/jhlagado/firth code for the TEC-1 and test its technical potency. 
* You will have to add serial hardware like Ben Grimmett's excellent https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SERIAL-BG .
* Or our experimental https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-APUS which has both serial and arithmetic abilities.
* Confirm if the AM9511 works in floating point calculations and Forth-Scientific libraries. 
* Now that you've accepted the mission, proceed to https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-FORTH/wiki
* This tape will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.” I.M.F.
