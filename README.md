“Your mission Steve, should you decide to accept it is to investigate John Hardy’s brilliant "Firth of Forth" code for the TEC-1, to confirm its technical potency and along with the tec-APUS hardware with its powerful AM9511 APU and Serial MC68B50P. Collect evidence that 32bit floating point calculations with Forth-Scientific code works. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Steve.” M.I
