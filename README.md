# tec-FORTH

# Abstract
Forth, TEC-1, Z80, 

# Introduction 

Based on the brilliant work by John Hardy we now have "Firth of Forth" (started 2019) for the TEC-1 targeting the Z80 CPU.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth

This project is to  test, confirm and use this powerful system.

# Observe and Question 
* Is "Firth of Forth" a viable and robust Forth?
* Review the technical manual and expand until comprehensively complete.

 
# Theory - testable
* Test and report any bugs back through git. 



# Prediction
* Trust John! "This is where the project gets interesting but nothing is ever smooth sailing, it's always hard"
* Need UART, eg tec-APUS
* Not enough RAM

# Method 

* Install UART, https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-APUS
* Install ROM Emulator, https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-ROM-EM-BG
* Load Forth, https://github.com/jhlagado/firth

"Firth is designed to run using a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial chip mapped to ports $80 and $81 (or 0x80 and 0x81) as per the hardware arrangement designed by Grant Searle." 
 

# Test
* JH internal tests
* Standard benchmark tests  
* Figforth, gforth, Peter Forth, etc
* Function test
* AM9511
* Forth Scientific Library
