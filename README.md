“Your mission Jim, should you decide to accept it is to investigate John Hardy’s secret "Firth of Forth" code for the TEC-1, to confirm its technical potency and along with the tec-APUS hardware with its powerful AM9511 APU and Serial MC68B50P. Collect evidence that 32bit floating point calculation work and Forth-Scientific code works. Report back all your findings. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.”
