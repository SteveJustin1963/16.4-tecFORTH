## Abstract
Forth, TEC-1, Z80, 

## Lit Review
https://dev.to/jhlagado/structured-programming-in-z80-assembly-554d

## Introduction 

Our honorary genius, John Hardy has developed "Firth of Forth" (2019) for the TEC-1. This project is to test and confirm this powerful system. Trust me!

## Observe and Question 
* Is "Firth of Forth" a viable and robust Forth?
* Review the technical manual and expand until comprehensively complete.

 
## Theory - testable
* Test and report any bugs back through git. 


## Prediction
"This is where the project gets interesting but nothing is ever smooth sailing, it's always hard" (Hardy 2020)

## Method 

## Load Forth into TEC-1
1. BitBang and hex file transfer in Zip archive, n.a. (Robertson 2019).
2. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-BANG, n.a. (Justin 2020).
3. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SERIAL-BG n.a. (Gremmett 2019).
3. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-VIDEO-BG with serial n.a. (Gremmett 2019).
4. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-BOOT n.a. (Justin 2020).
5. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-ROM-EM-BG, ROM Emulator ready!
6. Transfer https://github.com/jhlagado/firth to TEC-1. "Firth is designed to run using a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial chip mapped to ports $80 and $81 (or 0x80 and 0x81) as per the hardware arrangement designed by Grant Searle." (Hardy 2020). 
8. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-APUS, AM9511 + 6850, ready!

## Test
Boot !
1. JH internal tests
2. Standard benchmark tests  
3. Figforth, gforth, Peter Forth code, ANS
4. basic and extended word tests
5. AM9511 test routines
6. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-FORTH-SCIENTIFIC

## Iterate, new hypotheses or predictions

1. Update manual with all findings, make it comprehensive! 
Use https://code2flow.com/ to also explain code in flow-chart.
2. Squeeze Forth with mini Monitor into 4k ROM, active additional address line. (Hardy 2020)
3. Redesign TEC-1D per Grant Searle, 8k ROM + 56K RAM. https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/TEC-1D
